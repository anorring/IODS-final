# IODS-final
Repository for the final assignment of IODS2017.

In this final assignment I use logistic regression to find which variables can predict the probability of a given country achieving higher than average mean years of schooling. I use data from two UN indices, the Human Development Index and the Gender Inequality Index. I fit a logistic regression model to the data and calculate odds ratios. I also evaluate and validate the model using predictions and cross-validation.

I find that a marginal increase in the share of female population receiving secondary schooling results in a 20 % increase in the probability of a country achieving higher than average mean years of schooling. The model is very simple, but it has surprisingly good predictive abilities, which lend it more credence.
